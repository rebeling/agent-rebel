# Resume as Code

Resumes are often treated as static documents, but over time I found that approach limiting. I was looking for a way to keep my CV reliable, easy to update, and flexible enough to handle different formats and languages—especially when clarity and consistency across contexts mattered.

Traditional tools like Google Docs and PDF exports often introduced small but persistent issues: formatting quirks, inconsistent layout, or extra effort when translating.

What I needed was a more structured approach—something I could version, reuse, and export cleanly to web, print, or even machine-readable formats.


## JSON Resume: Great Concept, Mixed Execution

[JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) looked promising. It defines your resume in a single JSON file and lets you apply themes for HTML, PDF, and other outputs.

``` json title="resume.json" linenums="1"
{
  "basics": {
    "name": "Matthias Rebel",
    "label": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "image": "images/portrait.png",
    "summary": "A passionate ...",
```

It worked well inside their ecosystem: I published my resume as a GitHub Gist, connected it to their [live registry](https://registry.jsonresume.org), and instantly had shareable links with themes like:

https://registry.jsonresume.org/rebeling?theme={theme}

**[professional](https://registry.jsonresume.org/rebeling?theme=professional)**,
**[kendall](https://registry.jsonresume.org/rebeling?theme=kendall)**,
**[paper-plus-plus](https://registry.jsonresume.org/rebeling?theme=paper-plus-plus)**,
**[elegant](https://registry.jsonresume.org/rebeling?theme=elegant)**, ...

But the command-line tools were less reliable. Rendering didn’t always match what I saw online. And for a CV—where layout, clarity, and precision matter—that’s a problem.

## HackMyResume: CLI That Works
While the JSON Resume ecosystem showed a lot of promise, the command-line tooling didn’t quite hold up in day-to-day use. That’s where [HackMyResume](https://github.com/hackmyresume/hackmyresume) came in—it picked up where the official CLI fell short and delivered exactly what I needed: reliable, multi-format exports from a single JSON source.

Setup was straightforward. Installation took just a few seconds, and I was able to generate all major formats with a single command. No tweaking, no layout surprises—just consistent results.

Supported outputs include:

<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.7.0/css/all.min.css"
/>

<div style="display:flex; gap:2.25rem; justify-content: center; font-size:1.42rem;">
    <a href="/rebeling/rebeling/resume/out/positive/resume.pdf">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-file-pdf" style="color: #74C0FC;"></i>
    </a>
    <a href="/rebeling/rebeling/resume/out/positive/resume.doc">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-file-word" style="color: #74C0FC;"></i>
    </a>
    <a href="/rebeling/rebeling/resume/cv.html">
        <i class="fa-brands fa-html5" style="color: #74C0FC;"></i>
    </a>
    <a href="/rebeling/rebeling/resume/out/positive/resume.md" download>
        <i class="fa-brands fa-markdown" style="color: #74C0FC;"></i>
    </a>
    <a href="/rebeling/rebeling/resume/out/positive/resume.yml">
        <i class="fa-brands" style="font-size:1.1rem; color: #74C0FC;">yml</i>
    </a>
</div>


HackMyResume also supports custom themes, allowing you to control layout and styling across formats without duplicating effort. Once configured, it provided a reproducible, flexible resume pipeline that fits naturally into a developer workflow.

It’s a simple tool—but it solved the problem completely.

## Conclusion

I now maintain one resume file in JSON, versioned in Git, with scripted outputs for any channel. If you're a developer, this approach gives you automation, repeatability, and full control over presentation.

**Treat your resume like code—it scales better.**
