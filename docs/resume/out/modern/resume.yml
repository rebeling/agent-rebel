  brief: "I'm a passionate software developer who pairs deep technical expertise with a wide strategic lens. My background in computational linguistics lets me weave human-language technologies, machine learning, and AI into products that engage users and unlock new value. I'm currently diving into multi-agent systems—exploring how autonomous agents can cooperate to solve problems.\n\nWhether I'm building large-scale NLP pipelines or refining user flows, I keep one eye on the technical detail and the other on the bigger business goal. I thrive on continuous improvement: digging into complex topics, sharing what I learn, and iterating quickly through agile practices and automation. That mix of specialization and generalist mindset helps me deliver high-impact, real-world solutions on fast timelines.\n\nI approach every project with curiosity, empathy, and a bias for action—aligning smart technology choices with clear business outcomes."
